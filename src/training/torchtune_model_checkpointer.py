    Load HF checkpoint from file.

    The keys and weights from across all checkpoint files are merged into a single state_dict.
    We preserve the "state_dict key" <-> "checkpoint file" mapping in weight_map so we can
    write the state dict correctly in ``save_checkpoint``.

    Before returning, the model state dict is converted to a torchtune-compatible format using
    the appropriate convert_weights function (depending on ``self._model_type``).
